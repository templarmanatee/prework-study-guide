# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation to build this project was to regain a fundamental understanding of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this project because it was a good way to store the information I had gained while at the same time deploying it. It solves the issue of organizing my notetaking for the prework, storing all the code and associated notes in one page. I learned how to incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a working product, however small. I learned the syntax and proper ways to create a web document.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

This is a simple website to use. Its primary function is to contain notes for the coding bootcamp's prework in the same place that the code itself is written. Each section contains notes on a specific topic to serve as reminders. The console includes JavaScript in order to help you pick a topic to study. It will serve as a good reminder and reference tool for the future.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
